This is going to be a home dashboard for my Raspberry Pi home server, with basic stuff like a shopping list, a virtual corkboard so my girlfriend and I can leave notes for one another, and some home automation stuff using the Pi's GPIO and relays, etc.

Mainly this is an excuse for me to learn Redis, Vue and Bulma, and a showcase for prospective employers. It also uses Mongoose/MongoDB and Express.
